The integrity of the data is as supplied by multiple data providers.  An official 
FDEP spring name was assigned to assist in providing a generic naming 
convention to all Florida springs.  Where there was more than one spring in 
the state with a similar name the county was also included in the spring name.  
There may be times where the station name is inaccurate or does not adhere 
to the official FDEP naming convention.

The primary sources for this dataset were Florida Department of Environmental 
Protection's Springs combined database, online springs station inventories 
maintained by the State of Florida's Water Management Districts, data downloads 
from GWIS, STORET, USGS, and the Florida Geological Survey's Bulletin 31 
and 66 Springs of Florida publications. FDEP has revised the classification system 
for magnitude to report the recent magnitude for individual vents rather than 
combined groups. MAGNITUDE is based on the recent years discharge at an 
individual vent, HIST_MAG is based on discharge from historic years,  GROUP_MAG 
is based on the early years of the Springs Initiative where springs were grouped 
together to form 1st magnitude groups for funding purposes.  This classification system 
makes it possible to identify those springs that may stop flowing on an intermittent 
or permanent basis.  The Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) 
SPRING MAGNITUDE DEFINITIONS shown below differentiate between those springs 
that may flow once again in the future, depending on aquifer levels and recharge 
(Magnitude = 0), and those springs that have ceased flowing entirely and are not 
expected to recover regardless of changes in hydrogeologic and climatic conditions 
(Magnitude = None).<br /><br />

The Florida Geographic Data Library is a collection of Geospatial Data
compiled by the University of Florida GeoPlan Center with support from
the Florida Department of Transportation. GIS data available in FGDL is
collected from various state, federal, and other agencies (data sources)
who are data stewards, producers, or publishers. The data available in
FGDL may not be the most current version of the data offered by the
data source. University of Florida GeoPlan Center makes no guarantees
about the currentness of the data and suggests that data users check
with the data source to see if more recent versions of the data exist.

Furthermore, the GIS data available in the FGDL are provided 'as is'.

A note about data scale: 

Scale is an important factor in data usage.  Certain scale datasets
are not suitable for some project, analysis, or modeling purposes.
Please be sure you are using the best available data. 

1:24000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the
county level.
1:24000 data should NOT be used for high accuracy base mapping such
as property parcel boundaries.
1:100000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the
multi-county or regional level.
1:125000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the
regional or state level or larger.

Vector datasets with no defined scale or accuracy should be
considered suspect. Make sure you are familiar with your data
before using it for projects or analysis. Every effort has been
made to supply the user with data documentation. For additional
information, see the References section and the Data Source Contact

New layer obtained from WRM and inserted in ArcSDE and published in DataMiner

DataMiner.
Process Date: 20110615
<br />
GeoPlan downloaded this dataset from the Florida Department of Environmental 
Protection's GeoData Directory website (http://www.dep.state.fl.us/gis/datadir.htm) 
in June 2011. The data was downloaded in shapefile format and was in the following 
projection: Albers NAD 83 HARN. During the AQ/QC process the following tasks were undertaken:

- Uppercased all records in the table.
- A DESCRIPT field was added based on SPRING_NAM 
- A FGDLAQDATE field was added based on date downloaded from source.
- Renamed file from springs_2011 to springs_fdep_2011
